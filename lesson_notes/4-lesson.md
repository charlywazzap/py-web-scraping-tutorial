# Develop code

## Important things

- know your goals and hypothesis on data
- check correlations
- visualize
- check of bad data and remove bad data
- explore data
- keep it playful


## Requirements

- pip install pandas
- pip install seaborn

## Goals

- export to csv
- create dataframe to jupyter notebook using pandas
- Review data for missing data or problems
- matplot and  seaborn to graph
- report to tell visual story

## My Thoughts

- just add the code for timestamp in file name
- No information regarding how to use jupyter notebooks
- Videos look edited to be recorded by sentence then sticked together, it doesn't feel fluid or natural
- This lessons 4 is empty, I would require a jupyter notebook tutorial, seaborn and pandas
