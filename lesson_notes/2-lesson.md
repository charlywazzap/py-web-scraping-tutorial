# Scaping

## Important things

- Pages are not created to be scraped
- Think about HTML and how CSS works when scraping
- What is your strategy
  - single use
  - multiple pages
- Use Selectors
- Identify patterns in the HTML structure and selectors
- URL patterns
- Find shortcuts
- Regex is brittle
  - Very hard to read
  - Hard to support
- In Chome dev tools you can right click and copy selector

## Requirments 

- Insert in iphyton the [[2-ipython-commands]]

## My Thoughts

- Requirements should also include HTML understanding
- regex understanding
- Iphyton is useful for exploration and later translate it to code
- Videos end should allow a few seconds specially if you need to see a result, Found my self geting backto videos because i didnt see the result or copy the commend
- Courses should have a cheat sheet of commands that will be used
- Courses might need to be structured with the 4 types of "documents"
- Some videos are explanations
- Some are specific tutorials to teach you something
- Some are how to's
- Some are References ( this is very rare, rather this should be course material)

## Feelings

- Still not feeling that I have learned much
- when a rating for a "intermediate" level course many things are assumed and you may need to spend time researching
  

## Goals

- Use Chrome Dev Tools to look at data
- Check div and span elements
- Extract text
- Add confidence with unit testing
