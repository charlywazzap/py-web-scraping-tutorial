# Scaping

## Important things

- Check for success

## My Thoughts

- Course or pluralsight doesn't clearly provide requirements
- spent half of my time setting up env before learning anything useful in this first hour
- experience 2 out of 5

## Requirements

- local venv
- source web-scrape/bin/activate
- python v 3.7.1 +
- requests.txt
- Download material

## Goal

- Storage and Queries
- Data Augmentations
- Analysis and communications
- Maybe there are no API

## Why Static Pages

- Easy to scape
- Data Dumps are often statics
- Requests and BeautifulSoup

## Why Not Dynamic pages

- More difficult to scrape
- Requires selenium

## Site to scrape

- Locally severed from webpage `python -m http.server `
- Discover relationship in statistics
