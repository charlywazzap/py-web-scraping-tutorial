# Develop code

## Important things

- use notes from lessons 2 to develop code
- use clean code
- use caching when ever possible
- add timestamps if you store your data in a db
- test with assert or TDD
- use try except to catch unreliable data
- extract incrementally 

## Requirements

- pip install pytest 

## Goals

- Create clean script
- Use lessons 1 and 2 to build rows of the 9 elements
- Test code
- py.test test_scraper.py or py.test --disable-warnings test_scraper.py 

## My Thoughts

- altho using test are not part of the course, it would be good to show good for loop case testing.
- i didnt like that refactor is done via pycharm instead of explaining would rather start with psedo code then code.
- Code is super fast if its going to be this fast I would rather just pass the code to the user.
- I think that this section was wastful as it doesnt really teach good code practices and it really didnt add much to the web scraping
